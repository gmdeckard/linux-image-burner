# Demo script to show the improved linux-image-burner functionality
echo "=== linux-image-burner - Demo ==="
echo

# Check system requirements
echo "1. Checking system requirements..."
echo "   - pkexec (for privilege escalation): $(command -v pkexec >/dev/null && echo "✓ Available" || echo "✗ Missing")"
echo "   - dd (for disk imaging): $(command -v dd >/dev/null && echo "✓ Available" || echo "✗ Missing")"
echo "   - lsblk (for device detection): $(command -v lsblk >/dev/null && echo "✓ Available" || echo "✗ Missing")"

echo
echo "2. Key improvements made:"
echo "   ✓ No longer requires sudo to start the application"
echo "   ✓ Uses pkexec for privilege escalation only when needed"
echo "   ✓ Improved dd command with better progress monitoring"
echo "   ✓ Enhanced error handling and user feedback"
echo "   ✓ Proper temporary script cleanup"
echo "   ✓ Better bootable disk creation using dd"

echo
echo "3. How the burning process works now:"
echo "   - Application starts without root privileges"
echo "   - User selects ISO file and target device"
echo "   - When burning starts, application creates a temporary script"
echo "   - Script contains: dd if='image.iso' of='/dev/sdX' bs=1M conv=fdatasync status=progress"
echo "   - pkexec requests admin password and executes the script"
echo "   - Progress is monitored and displayed to user"
echo "   - Device is synced and script is cleaned up"

echo
echo "4. Testing the GUI application..."
echo "   Starting application (no sudo required)..."

# Launch the application
cd /home/gdeckard/usb-burn/build
./linux-image-burner &

echo "   Application started in background"
echo "   - GUI should appear without asking for root password"
echo "   - Device list should populate with available devices"
echo "   - When you click 'Start', it will request admin privileges via pkexec"
echo "   - dd command will create a proper bootable disk"

echo
echo "5. Installation instructions:"
echo "   sudo ./install.sh"
echo "   This will:"
echo "   - Install the binary to /usr/local/bin"
echo "   - Install desktop file for GUI access"
echo "   - Install polkit policy for proper privilege handling"

echo
echo "=== Demo completed ==="
echo "The application should now work properly for creating bootable USB drives!"
